## What We Welcome

### Detection Rules (most impactful)

New YAML detection rules are the easiest and most impactful contribution. Add rules to `rules/` following this format:

```yaml
- id: COMMUNITY-001
  name: my_detection_rule
  category: direct_injection  # or: jailbreak, data_loss, tool_poisoning, evasion
  technique: technique_name
  severity: HIGH              # LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL
  patterns:
    - '(?i)your regex here'
  score: 0.80                 # 0.0 to 1.0
```

Include test cases showing what should and should not match.

### Bug Fixes

- Clear description of the bug and how to reproduce it
