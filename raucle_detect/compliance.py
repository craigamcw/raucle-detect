"""Compliance evidence packs (P4) — map the receipt chain to named controls.

A regulated buyer's recurring question is *"show me your agent-authorization
evidence."* raucle already produces a signed, offline-verifiable receipt chain;
this module turns that chain into a **control-mapped compliance report**: for a
named framework (EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001, SOC 2), which controls the chain
*evidences*, with the concrete counts/receipts that satisfy each, and an honest
statement of what is out of scope.

This is deliberately an **evidence map, not a conformance attestation.** raucle
evidences a *subset* of each framework — the record-keeping, access-control, and
monitoring controls its primitives genuinely address. Full compliance needs
other artifacts and an assessor. Every control below states exactly what the
chain proves and what it does not, in the same honest posture as the
[OWASP](../docs/standards/owasp-agentic-top10-mapping.md) and
[NIST](../docs/standards/nist-ai-agent-standards-alignment.md) mappings.

Usage::

    from raucle_detect.compliance import build_report, render_markdown
    report = build_report("receipts.jsonl", framework="eu-ai-act")
    print(render_markdown(report))

CLI: ``raucle-detect compliance report receipts.jsonl --framework eu-ai-act``.
