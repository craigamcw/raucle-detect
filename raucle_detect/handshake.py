"""Cross-organisation agent handshake (P2) — trust resolved from the registry.

P1 (the :mod:`~raucle_detect.trust_registry`) made issuer keys *resolvable* across
orgs. P2 is the protocol that uses it: two agents from different organisations
establish a verifiable, capability-gated call and exchange signed receipts —
**without any prior key exchange between them.** Each side resolves the other's
key from the shared Trust Registry.

The flow (org A's agent calls org B's agent):

    org A                         shared registry                      org B
    -----                         ---------------                      -----
    mint capability token  --------- publish kA -------->  (kA resolvable)
    present (token, tool, args)  ----------------------------------->  accept_call()
                                       resolve kA  <------------------    │
                                  (fail-closed if unknown/revoked)        │
                                                                gate.check(token, args)
    verify B's ack  <----------- publish kB ------------- emit signed ack receipt
    (resolve kB)                                                          │

Org B never held org A's key beforehand; it resolves ``token.key_id`` from the
registry, checks revocation, runs the capability gate, and answers with a signed
acknowledgement that org A verifies the same way (resolving B's key). The result
is a cross-org receipt pair anchored in the registry — the interop primitive for
multi-agent ecosystems.

Fail-closed throughout: an initiator key that is unknown or revoked in the
registry is rejected before the gate ever runs.
