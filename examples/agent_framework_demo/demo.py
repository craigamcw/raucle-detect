"""Microsoft Agent Framework × raucle — wiring reference.

This file shows the *integration shape*. It is intentionally not a one-shot
runnable script: a live Agent Framework deployment also needs a chat
client (OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, or a local Ollama) and the deployer's
own tool implementations. What follows is the four-line wire-up plus the
session-token binding pattern, with type-checked references to the real
``raucle.integrations.agent_framework`` API.

For the *verified behaviour* of the middleware (ALLOW path, DENY path,
no-token path, receipt content), see the unit test suite:

    tests/integrations/test_agent_framework.py

Those tests run without any host LLM and exercise the full
``RaucleFunctionMiddleware.process`` contract against a mocked Agent
Framework invocation context.

Run sequence (when adapted into a real deployment)

# Step 1 — once per process — wire up the issuer, gate, and audit sink.
# In production: the issuer key lives in an HSM, the audit sink writes to
# durable storage, and the public key is published on the deployer's
# .well-known/ for any third-party verifier to fetch.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2 — build the agent and attach raucle as a FunctionMiddleware.
# This is the only change to a deployer's existing Agent Framework code:
# one constructor call + one middleware registration.

    chat_client=OpenAIChatClient(model="gpt-4o"),

    )
)


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3 — at the start of each user session, derive a capability token
# from the user's actual request and bind it to the asyncio context.
# The token authorises only the lookup_customer tool; transfer_funds is
# *not* in the token's tool set, so any attempt to call it during this
# session will be denied by the gate.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 4 — run the agent normally. Every tool call passes through the
# raucle middleware; each ALLOW/DENY produces a signed receipt in
# RECEIPT_LOG. The audit chain is verifiable offline by any third party
# holding the issuer's published public key.
