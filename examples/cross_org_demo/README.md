# Cross-org agent handshake — trust from a shared registry

A **runnable** demo (no API key, no network) of the interop primitive for
multi-agent ecosystems: two organisations establish a verifiable, capability-gated
call **without any prior key exchange between them.**

```bash
pip install 'raucle-detect[compliance]'
python examples/cross_org_demo/demo.py
```

Two orgs (a bank and a payments gateway) each publish their issuer key to ONE
shared [Trust Registry](../../docs/getting-started/10-trust-registry.md). Then:

1. **Org A calls Org B with a legitimate $50 transfer.** Org B has never held
   Org A's key — it resolves it from the registry, capability-gates the call,
   and returns a signed ACCEPT that Org A verifies the same way (resolving B).
2. **A prompt-injected $9,900 transfer to an attacker is REJECTED** at Org B's
   gate. The signed REJECT ack still verifies.
3. **Org A's key is revoked in the registry** → Org B rejects *before the gate
   even runs*. Revocation propagates to every verifier through the shared
   registry, with no bilateral coordination.

The point: trust comes from the shared registry, not a per-pair key swap. That
is the network effect — each org that publishes makes the next cross-org
verification trivial. The exit code is a CI self-test
([tests/test_handshake.py](../../tests/test_handshake.py)).
