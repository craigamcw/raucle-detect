"""LangChain × raucle — a runnable prompt-injection demo with a verified receipt chain.

No API key, no network, no model download. The "agent brain" is scripted so the
demo is deterministic and runs in CI, but every tool call goes through the real
LangChain tool/callback machinery (`tool.run(..., callbacks=[handler])`) and the
real raucle capability gate. That is the point of the architecture: the gate
does not care *why* the agent decided to make a call — a poisoned document and
a legitimate user request take the same path, and only the signed constraints
decide.

Three scenes:

1. The user asks for a legitimate $45 invoice payment      → gate ALLOWS, runs.
2. A retrieved document carries a prompt injection telling
   the agent to wire $9,900 to an attacker                  → gate DENIES, blocked.
3. An offline verifier replays the signed receipt chain     → both decisions
   are independently provable; tampering with one byte is detected.

Run it:

    pip install 'raucle[compliance,langchain]'
    python examples/langchain_demo/demo.py
